Done:
Set up shaders in main.js
- Finished the fundamentals page


Next:
Follow the 3D perspective tutorial
Less code, more fun
Then drawing multiple things


TODO:
- set up to draw geometry
- 3D perspective matrices
- multiple meshes
- mesh from file
- skybox
- environment mapping
- noise mesh
- colored faces?? colored vertices?
- textures
- water bump map


Issues:

Waves: need to track just the origin of the wave
Surface height is computed as the sum of the waves
... How does that work? the wave doesn't reach the point immediately
It should be possible... should be relatively straightforward math...
