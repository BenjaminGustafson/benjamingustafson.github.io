Issues:
- Leaving the nav puzzle and coming back results in a new puzzle, or refreshing the page
    - Solution: keep track of the current nav puzzle in the state storage
- MathBlock height causes layout issues
    - Could make them not get taller with more nesting ... would it still be possible to tell how it is nested?
        Then you need parantheses. Is it bad to not have parantheses? Teaching a bad habit

Todo:
- Generate asteroids locations, and put them on left grid
- Move nav grids down to make room
- Show asteroids on progress bar
    - How long is ship icon? is it too big

- Swap out new art
- Nav puzzles not available when planet is in progress

- What if the whole navigation is a HUD with stars in the background? what are the ship interior scenes then?
- Nav puzzles mix in quad puzzles
- Nav puzzles serve according to mastery score
- Make projectile launch scene (more similar to puzzle than navigation), i.e. don't use mathblocks...
- Vary only launch velocity with a slider, display gravity, and show trajectory before launch
- Only target is landing spot

- Quad puzzles are somehow connected with the environment,

- NPCs with dialogue
- Ship computer

- Bonus distance accumulates with correct answers


- Exponential puzzles
- Ramp where targets match to function value
- Ramp where target match to twice function value?
- Really need dialogue here explaining what is going on
