TODO in order of importance

- Have to have parentheses for mathblocks. Will cause to many issues otherwise

- Quad lab visual (dropping a ball or apple)
- Quad dialogue
- Quad mathblock tutorial

Post demo

- Linear bonus: draw. Unlocked after lab is visited (not necessarily solved).
    Add a couple of linear drawing and a couple of nonlinear

- Exponential, Sine, Power, Sum, Product, Chain content

- Better graph zoom
- Planet icons
- Journal. Could just list derivative rules.
- Experiment scene better backgrounds

- Improve planet map. has progress, has lines
- Mathblock destructive - hard
- Sandbox mode: set f(x) and f'(x) - easy
- Navigation has some sort of warning about asteroid field.
- UI element borders - easy
- Curated nav puzzles - to avoid the wild ones
- Map elements highlight when moused over
- Square graphs even with not square scale
- Sliders +/- 1 buttons
- Redo linear map? not a priority, finish all content first

---------------------------------
Experiment Design:
- Sliders show current value
- Lets you play with parameters, vs parameters already chosen. Not a huge difference, but
- Could use an integral tracer on the derivative function guess, but theres not enough space


Navigation improvements:


UI Improvements:
- Mathblocks shrink when max size is reached



Linear:


Maps:
Conifer forest
Mountain with stone
Pink trees
Desert
Lake, boardwalk, lilypads
Beach

----------------------------



BUGS / Issues:

- sin( e^x ), sin( any large function ) becomes a hash,
     solution: detect these functions and remove targets in affected range
     solution 2: do not allow sine ( any value over 1000 ) 
     solution 3: tall targets - for sine ( f(x) ) if |ddx f(x)| > 10, make the targets cover the affected range...
     Make the targets tall enough to connect from previous to next...
     If it is just sine that has this issue, it should be solveable since -1 < sine < 1

- Timer slider jumps to next whole number by rounding rather than floor, which is good for mouse interaction, but bad for playing the slider
    Solution: update the time slider only when the time value hits a new int



Other UI elements list:

- Rule mode for mathblocks: rather than constructing mathblock functions, start with the f(x) and
    apply rules until you get to f'(x). There would be a toggle next to the toolbar that switches to 
    rules. You click on the rule and then the block you want to apply it to. There could be some sort of 
    coloring that helps you keep track of which blocks you have ddxed so far.

- Draw mode for puzzles: Allows you to set a lot of slider-like objects easily. Rather than using Slider
    just make a new object that attaches to the grid and draws the circles or squares. The y would be set 
    for each x whenever the mouse is down and over the grid. Like if (mouse is down and over grid) set grid x = y

Quality of life improvements:

- Integral tracer starts at first point on nav grid (improves qol since an incorrect function is more likely to be visible)
- Mathblocks can attach as parents
- Mathblocks auto fill with x's (when there is no child)
- Click on a block to copy its scale and translate? Or just give a copy paste ability...

Accessibility:
- Keyboard controls
- Mobile ?
