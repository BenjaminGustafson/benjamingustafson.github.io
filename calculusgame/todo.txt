You can skip to the rule, and if you get it right, you can go to the next planet 

1. Expirement scene
    8. Sliders on right graph adjust tracer on left between measurement points?
    9. Mathblock for guessing f'(x), only shows f'(x), not the corresponding f(x)
    10. scene takes you to menu when correct
    11. menu updates
    12. scenes save progress (fn solved)

Experiments are in four stages:
    1. add measurements
    2. and guess f(x)
    3. adjust derivatives
    4. and guess f'(x) 

2. Rule guess scene
    1. Text with mathblock vars now instead of numbers - does that work if the token isnt x?
    2. Set vars with sliders? Maybe not. How are you going to do like f(x) or f'(x) in the future. It might work
    3. If thats too much work, just have two mathblock fields <-


3. Ship scene
    1. gives planet progress when on planet
    2. 

4. Navigation
    1. Doesn't let you go past incomplete planet
    2. puzzles cycle

5. Quadratic
    1. set up levels menu like linear
    2. Experimnet: like linear but with an apple

6 Exponential
    1. Puzzles
    2. Expirement
