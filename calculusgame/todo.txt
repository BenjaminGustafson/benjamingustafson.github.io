Issues:
- Leaving the nav puzzle and coming back results in a new puzzle


Todo:
2. Graph labels
- 
3. Function scale
4. Destination
5. Tool tip



Art:
I don't like how dark the current art is, replace it with more cheerful

Navigation levels:
- Progress bar:
    - Displays distance to next planet
    - Has an icon for the ship
    - Fills with different color
    - Textbox that says destination?

- Left graph:
    - Axis labels
    - Grid labels

- Sliders:
    - When no block is selected, hidden
        Display tool tip
    - 1 or 2 sliders: 2 because of linear function

- Mathblocks:
    - Starts with just constant
    - More unlocked during progression
    - Limited supply - 1 of each to start with

 

- Overall alignment

Gameplay loop:
    - Gamestate variables:
        - Max distance from current puzzle
        - Total distance
        - History of answers (correct or incorrect) for each section
    - Grid size scaled to max distance per puzzle (actual distance depends on rng) 
    - Penalty for getting questions wrong, max distance decreases until it hits a minimum.
    - Reward for getting questions right is max distance increases linearly. With no upper bound.
    - For example, distance from planet 1 to 2 is 1000 km, min distance is 100km, bonus is 10km, penalty is 20km.
    - 3 tries before answer is revealed and you skip question -- doesnt this mean that you could succeed by only answering questions from section 1?
        - Yes, but this would bring your speed way down 

    100+150+200+250+300
    5-10 qs
    350+400+450+500+550
    1000
    2250
    3500
    500 1.5k 3k
    Doesn't matter bc it won't be exact you can expect it to be like half that on average

    - Keep track of puzzle accuracy for each section, recency weighted
    Function for how much to assign puzzle: sum over i from 1 (most recent) to n (least recent) of a_i * n^(alpha)
    For some decay rate alpha < 0   or alpha^n? would be decay rate...
    a_i = one value for correct, another (negative) value for incorrect
    You could test this out, or look at literature



- Answer 20 linear questions correct to unlock the constant rule
    - tricky to figure out how to do this...
    - First click on the function, to put the right graph in deconstructive mode
    - At first the function will be the same as f(x) and the blocks will all be red
    - Then click on a rule, like constant rule
    - Then click on a mathblock to apply the rule (need highlight hover)
    - If the rule applies the mathblock becomes green
    Ex: f(x) = -2x + 2 -> sum rule -> (y -2x) g+ (y +2) -> constant rule -> (y -2x) g+ (g 0) -> power rule -> g -2 + 0
Are you allowed to tinker with the mathblocks during the process? probably not a good idea... 
In that case... how do you switch back to manual input mode?
