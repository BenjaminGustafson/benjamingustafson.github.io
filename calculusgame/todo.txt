Issues:
- Leaving the nav puzzle and coming back results in a new puzzle, or refreshing the page


Todo:
1. Arrival at quadratic planet
4. Make quadratic scene
5. Put puzzle ramp in quadratic
6. Door opens to quadratic
7. Nav puzzles after go to exp
8. Nav puzzles mix in quad puzzles
9. Make projectile launch scene (more similar to puzzle than navigation), i.e. don't use mathblocks...
- If not using mathblocks, then how to make function continuous?
10. Vary only launch velocity with a slider, display gravity, and show trajectory before launch
11. Only target is landing spot
12. Move between launches with next button, but art makes it seem like you are moving across the planet?



1. Course charted confirmation
6. Bonus distance
7. Puzzle accuracy (do this after there are multiple types of puzzles)
8. star animation during travel (want)






Art:
I don't like how dark the current art is, replace it with more cheerful

Want to have features:
- Nonlinear exploration, e.g. you could go to cubic or exp after quadratic
- Map
- Teleportation to completed planets
