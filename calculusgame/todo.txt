Split scenes into separate files


Finishing exps
- Issues: its too hard to tell what to do, and if you are on the right track

Finishing nav
- Generate random functions

- Grids can auto adjust y-scale (maybe as a function tracer option?)

Overall navigation:
- Overworld like mario?
- Left to right, some forking paths
- Isometric projection, but just 2d
- What does ship view become? 
- What do navigation levels become?
- You can do the same logic for planet map as subplanet maps
- Travel across the planet to get to a lab, in the lab you do an experiment. The experiment unlocks a ship upgrade. Shortcut unlocks when you reach the end
- Does the whole map fit on one screen? Would make it more manageable
- Npcs along path with dialogue

Linear planet - forest
Quad - desert
Chain rule - pink snow
