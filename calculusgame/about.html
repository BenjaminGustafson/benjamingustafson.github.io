    <h1>A puzzle game that teaches calculus</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>
     The goal of this game is to teach calculus through interactive puzzles. 
     The game is not intended to replace an entire calculus course, rather to be a supplement for a traditional classroom course. 
     The game focuses on building intuition for the core concept of Calc I, the derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I took calculus for the first time, I memorized all of the derivative rules without any understanding of why the rules are true.
      This got me through class fine, but left me with a shallow understanding. 
      Calculus textbooks often give proofs of derivative rules, but these proofs are above the mathematical reading level of the typical calculus student.
    </p>
    <p>
      The puzzles in the game aim to build intuition on the relationship between the graph of a function and its derivative.
      Below is an early puzzle from the game. The graph on the left represents some function, $f$, and the graph on the right is its derivative $f'$.
      The player sets the values of $f'$ by moving the circles on graph on the right.
      The puzzle is solved by setting the values of $f'$ so that $f$ hits the square targets.

      We can add more points so that the graph becomes smoother.
      The piecewise functions shown below approach $f(x) = x^2/2$ and $f'(x) = x$.
      In this example, the puzzle is building the intuition as to why a quadratic function has a linear function as its derivative.

    <h3>Games for motivation</h3>
    <p>
      Video games offer a potentially more compelling way to study calculus or other subjects.
      No one would deny that a textbook or a video lecture are good ways to learn calculus. 
      Video games are just another medium, like books or videos. 
      They are unique in that they are interactive, and interactivity can give some advantages.
    </p>
    
    <!-- 
      For many students, calculus is a class that they are required to take, not one that they elect to take out of interest for the subject.
      There is a greater burden on us, the people claiming students should take calculus, to provide motivation.
    <p>
      Another advantage games have over an exercise set is that there is a strict set of confines on the player.
      If you have ever helped a struggling student, one of the most common issues is that they don't know where to start. 
      They have a problem, like taking the derivative of a given function, but they don't know what they are allowed to do or not allowed to do.
      They are faced with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil and the unlimited possibilities of things that they could write.
      Games are much more approachable since they   -->
