    <h1>A puzzle game that teaches calculus</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>
     The goal of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept game where the player solves puzzles, and learns calculus along the way. 
     This game is not intended to replace a calculus course.
     A calculus course will demand upwards of 100 hours of a student's time, which is too large of a scope for this small game.
     The game focuses on building intuition for the core concept of Calc I, the derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students in a calculus course can develop a shallow understanding of the derivative if they focus too much on the algebraic mechanics of taking a derivative.
      The derivative has an essential graphical interpretation as the slope of the tangent line.
      The puzzles in the game are based on the relationship between the graph of a function and its derivative.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a standard puzzle the graph on the left represents some function, $f$, and the graph on the right is its derivative $f'$.
      The player sets the values of $f'$ by moving the circles on graph on the right.
      The puzzle is solved by setting the values of $f'$ so that $f$ hits the square targets.
      We can add more targets (squares) and sliders (circles) so that the graph becomes smoother.

    <p>
      We can use this style of puzzle to teach derivative rules. In the above puzzle, we see that $f$ is quadratic and so $f'$ is linear.
    </p>


    <p>
      Students are often led to memorize derivative rules.
      There are popular mnemonics like "fig gif" (f'g + g'f) for the power rule.
      In my opinion, mnemonics show a lack of depth of understanding.
      A student should be able to give some explanation as to why each derivative rule holds.
      A calculus textbook might give proofs of the rules, but these proofs are above the mathematical reading level of the typical student.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      Along with building intuition, games offer possibly a more compelling way to study calculus or other subjects.
      For many students, calculus is a class that is required for their major, and can be perceived as a hurdle in the way of them doing what they actually want to.
      Thus, there is some responsibility on the people teaching calculus to motivate the student.
      Video game design is in a way the study of motivation.
      Games are designed to be "fun", a nebulous term that could mean enjoyable in the moment or bringing long term satisfaction.
      For students who find exercise sets, whiteboard lectures, and dry textbooks a bit boring, games offer a way to increase motivation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another advantage games have over an exercise set is that there is a strict set of confines on the player.
      If you have ever helped a struggling student, one of the most common issues is that they don't know where to start. 
      They have a problem, like taking the derivative of a given function, but they don't know what they are allowed to do or not allowed to do.
      They are faced with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil and the unlimited possibilities of things that they could write.
      Games are much more approachable since they   -->

    <h2>Current state of the game</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
      A first version of the puzzle format is complete.
      All of the puzzles need to be playtested.
      The art is all placeholder, just to give a rough idea of the theme.
