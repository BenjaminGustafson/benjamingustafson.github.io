    <h1>A puzzle game that teaches calculus</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>
     The goal of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept game where the player solves puzzles, and learns calculus along the way. 
     The game is not intended to replace an entire calculus course, rather to be a supplement for a traditional classroom course. 
     The game focuses on building intuition for the core concept of Calc I, the derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students in a calculus course can develop a shallow understanding of the derivative if they focus too much on the algebraic mechanics of taking a derivative.
      The puzzles in the game aim to build intuition on the relationship between the graph of a function and its derivative.

    <p>
      The above shows an early puzzle from the game. The graph on the left represents some function, $f$, and the graph on the right is its derivative $f'$.
      The player sets the values of $f'$ by moving the circles on graph on the right.
      The puzzle is solved by setting the values of $f'$ so that $f$ hits the square targets.

    <p>
      We can add more targets (squares) and sliders (circles) so that the graph becomes smoother.
      The piecewise functions above approach $f(x) = x^2/2$ and $f'(x) = x$.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Students are often led to memorize derivative rules, but this leads to a lack of depth of understanding.
      A student should be able to give some explanation as to why each derivative rule holds.
      A calculus textbook might give proofs of the rules, but these proofs are above the mathematical reading level of the typical student.
    </p>

    <p>
      Video games offer a potentially more compelling way to study calculus or other subjects.
      For many students, calculus is a class that they are required to take, not one that they elect to take out of interest for the subject.
      There is a greater burden on us, the people claiming that the student should take calculus, to provide motivation.
    </p>

    <!-- 
    <p>
      Another advantage games have over an exercise set is that there is a strict set of confines on the player.
      If you have ever helped a struggling student, one of the most common issues is that they don't know where to start. 
      They have a problem, like taking the derivative of a given function, but they don't know what they are allowed to do or not allowed to do.
      They are faced with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil and the unlimited possibilities of things that they could write.
      Games are much more approachable since they   -->

    <h2>Current state of the game</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
      A first version of the puzzle format is complete.
      All of the puzzles need to be playtested.
      The art is all placeholder, just to give a rough idea of the theme.
