    <h1>What is this game?</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>
     This is a game where the player solves 2D puzzles, and learns calculus along the way.  
    </p>

    <h1>Where is the game currently at in development?</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The art is all placeholders, just to give a rough idea. All of the puzzles need to be playtested.
    </p>

    <h1>The gap in calculus pedagogy</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
    The game aims to teach derivative rules.
    Calculus students are often led to memorize these rules.
    Their textbook might give proofs of the rules, but this is above the reading level of the typical student.
    Further, an algebraic proof doesn't give an intuitive explanation for why the rule is true.
    </p>
    <p>

        One advantage of a video game over an exercise set is that there is a strict set of confines on the player.
        If you have ever helped a struggling student, one of the most common issues is that they don't know where to start. 
        They have a problem, like take the derivative of a given function, but they don't know what they are allowed to do or not allowed to do.
        They are faced with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil and the unlimited possibilities of things that they could write.
    </p>
    <p>

        Another advantage of games is that they give instant feedback.
        They can prevent the player from moving on until they have mastered a skill.
    </p> 
    

    <h1>The untapped potential of educational games</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Video game design has developed many strategies for making things fun.
        Games make otherwise boring tasks enjoying and compelling. 
        For example, there is not something inheretly fun about clicking on targets with a mouse.
        But when themed as shooting an enemy with a gun, when a score is attached, when a hit makes a satisfying sound effect, 
        the task becomes more fun.
          
        Rarely do games try to make that core task into something educational. 
        There are successful examples of gamification like Duolingo or Khan Academy.

        In the case of puzzle games, the underlying task can be framed as a mathematical problem.
