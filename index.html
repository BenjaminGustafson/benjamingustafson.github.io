    <h1>The distance between two sets</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>
      Suppose you wanted to define the distance between two sets of points in a metric space.
      It would be nice if you could define it so that the distance between two sets is also a metric.
      Then for any metric space, we would get another metric space (whose elements are subsets of the original metric space) for free!
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's call the two sets $A$ and $B$, and say they came from a metric space $(X,d)$.
    </p>
    <p>
      An initial attempt might be to find the two points in $A$ and $B$ that are closest to each other, and say that the distance between the sets is 
      equal to the distance between those points.
    </p>
    <p>
      One problem â€” what happens if I have two sets that overlap but aren't the same?
      Their distance would be zero.
      Recall that this would violate the condition on a metric space that distance zero implies equality.
