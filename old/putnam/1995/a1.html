<h2>Putnam 1995 - A1</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
    Let $S$ be a set of real numbers which is closed under multiplication
    (that is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $S$, then so is $ab$).
    Let $T$ and $U$ be disjoint subsets of $S$ whose union is $S$.
    Given that the product of any <i>three</i> (not necessarily distinct)
    elements of $T$ is in $T$ and that the product of any three elements of
    $U$ is in $U$, show that at least one of the two subsets $T, U$ is closed
    under multiplication.
</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
    Assume that both $T$ and $U$ are not closed under multiplication.
    Then there exist $t_1, t_2 \in T$ such that $t_1 t_2 \notin T$ and $u_1, u_2 \in U$
    such that $u_1 u_2 \notin U$.
</p>
<p>
    Since $U \subset S$, $u_1, u_2 \in S$.
    And since $S$ is closed $u_1 u_2 \in S$. 
    Then $u_1 u_2$ must be in either $U$ or $T$ since $U \cup T = S$,
    but cannot be in both since $U \cap T = \varnothing$.
    Thus, $u_1 u_2 \in T$.
</p>
<p>
    By the same logic, $t_1 t_2 \in U$.  
    Then since the product of any three elements of $U$ is in $U$,
    \[
    (t_1 t_2) u_1 u_2 \in U.
    \]
    And since the product of any three elements of $T$ is in $T$,
    \[
    t_1 t_2 (u_1 u_2) \in T
    \] 
    This contradicts the assumption that $U \cap T = \varnothing$.
