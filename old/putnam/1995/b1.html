<h2>Putnam 1995 - B1</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
    For a partition $\pi$ of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, let $\pi(x)$ be the number
    of elements in the part containing $x$. Prove that for any two partitions $\pi$
    and $\pi'$, there are two distinct numbers $x$ and $y$ in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
    such that $\pi (x) = \pi (y)$ and $\pi'(x) = \pi'(y)$. [A <i>partition</i> of a set 
    $S$ is a collection of disjoint subsets (parts) whose union is $S$.]

<h3>How to Solve It</h3>
<p>
    Finding two elements that 
    This sounds like it could be solved with the pigeonhole principle,
    although its not immediately obvious what the pigeons are and what the holes are.
    When using the pigeonhole principle, it can be
    helpful to consider the worst case scenario.
    In this problem, it is easier to find $x$ and $y$
    if the parts of the partition are large. If the parition 
    is one set of size 9, all of the elements have the same size.
    So, a worst case scenario would maximize the number of possible sizes
    in the partition,
    and minimize the number of elements that have the same size.
    We can guess that a worst case scenario for this problem 
    is where the parts are of size 2, 3, and 4.

<p>
    Here we have both $\pi$ and $\pi'$ with sizes of 2, 3, and 4.
    This is where the pigeonhole principle comes in.
    We have four elements with the same size part in $\pi$.
    So there must be some part of $\pi'$ that
    has two elements from the group of four.

    Note that it doesn't matter 
</p>
<p>
    Now all we have to do is prove that every partition has
    at least 4 elements that have the same size part, 
    and at most 3 sizes of parts.
</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
    Any partition of nine elements has at least four elements that have the same size part.
    A partition with a part of size $4,5,6,7,8,9$ has 4 or more elements with the same
    size part. A partition with only $1,2,3$ .
    
    A partition with four parts of different size must have at least $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$ elements.
    Thus, there are at most three sizes of parts in a partition on 9 elements. 
</p>
<p>
    So we have 4 elements with the same size parts in $\pi$.
    And there are only 3 possible sizes of parts in $\pi'$.
    By the pigeonhole principle, there must be two of those four elements, call them $x$ and $y$,
    that have the same size part in $\pi'$.
    Thus, $\pi(x) = \pi(y)$ and $\pi'(x) = \pi'(y)$.
