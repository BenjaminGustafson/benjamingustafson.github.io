<h2>Putnam 1995</h2>

<h3>A1</h3>
<p>
    Let $S$ be a set of real numbers which is closed under multiplication
    (that is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $S$, then so is $ab$).
    Let $T$ and $U$ be disjoint subsets of $S$ whose union is $S$.
    Given that the product of any <i>three</i> (not necessarily distinct)
    elements of $T$ is in $T$ and that the product of any three elements of
    $U$ is in $U$, show that at least one of the two subsets $T, U$ is closed
    under multiplication.

<h3>B1</h3>
<p>
    For a partition $\pi$ of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, let $\pi(x)$ be the number
    of elements in the part containing $x$. Prove that for any two partitions $\pi$
    and $\pi'$, there are two distinct numbers $x$ and $y$ in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
    such that $\pi (x) = \pi (y)$ and $\pi'(x) = \pi'(y)$. [A <i>partition</i> of a set 
    $S$ is a collection of disjoint subsets (parts) whose union is $S$.]
