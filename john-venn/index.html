        Venn's mathematical work mainly focused on logic, following the work done by George Boole and Augustus De Morgan.
        He published three books on logic, <i>The Logic of Chance</i> (1866), <i>Symbolic Logic</i> (1881), and <i>The Principles of Empirical Logic</i> (1889).
        Venn is best known for introducing diagrams of overlapping circles that represented sets and logical statements, which are now known as Venn diagrams.
